2D Text bounce effect for spark AR filter

Most people are really have tough time with 2D text filters that getting aproved by the facebook.To solve this problem I have created a simple patches, this patche will help you get the approval, it worked for me most of the time but it's not 100% viable option. So feel free to give a try. Don't blame me if it not working. Am just giving you a viable choice.

How to Use:

Just drag and drop the patch into patch editor and enter the XY cordinates of your 2D text that where it want to be placed on the screen thats it. Patch will do the rest. Make sure 2D text object must be inside the canvas to work correctly with the patch values.
